# Covariance with a component-constant mark

If a statistic has the same componentwise expectation profile up to an
error, then its covariance with any bounded function of the component tag is
of that same error size.  This elementary mixture identity is the exact
between-cell estimate needed for the fixed head coordinates in Lemma 8.6.

/-- A common component expectation profile makes the covariance with a
bounded tag function small.  The conclusion includes the between-component
covariance; it is not an average of within-component covariances. -/
